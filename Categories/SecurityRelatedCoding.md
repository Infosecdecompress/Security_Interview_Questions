# Security Related Coding & algorithms

- The basics
  - Conditions (if, else).
  - Loops (for loops, while loops).
  - Dictionaries.
  - Slices/lists/arrays.
  - String/array operations (split, contaings, length, regular expressions).
  - Pseudo code (concisely describing your approach to a problem).

- Data structures
  - Dictionaries / hash tables (array of linked lists, or sometimes a BST).
  - Arrays.
  - Stacks.
  - SQL/tables. 
  - Bigtables.

- Sorting
  - Quicksort, merge sort.

- Searching 
  - Binary vs linear.

- Big O 
  - For space and time.

- Regular expressions
  - O(n), but O(n!) when matching.
  - It's useful to be familiar with basic regex syntax, too.

- Recursion 
  - And why it is rarely used.

- Python
  - List comprehensions and generators [ x for x in range() ].
  - Iterators and generators.
  - Slicing [start:stop:step].
  - Regular expressions.
  - Types (dynamic types), data structures.
  - Pros and cons of Python vs C, Java, etc.
  - Understand common functions very well, be comfortable in the language.

## Security themed coding challenges

- Cyphers / encryption algorithms 
  - Be able to implement basic cyphers.

- Parse arbitrary logs 
  - Practice text parsing.

- Web scrapers 
  - Another way to practice text parsing.

- Port scanners 
  - Practice parsing network information.

- Botnets
  - How would you build ssh botnet.

- Password bruteforcer
- Scrape meta data from PDFs 
- Script to recover deleted items
- A program that looks for malware signatures in binaries / code samples
